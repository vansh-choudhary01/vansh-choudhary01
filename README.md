## 🚀 About Me  

I'm a **Full Stack Developer** passionate about building **real-time, scalable, and interactive** web systems.  
Over time, I’ve moved from basic backend projects to working on **WebRTC, WebSocket**, and **AI-integrated** applications that push the limits of what can run inside a browser.  

I love experimenting with how **AI and code** can work together — from prompt-based code generation to local in-browser execution using **WebContainers**.  

Recently, I built an **AI-powered Website Builder** where users can simply give prompts, and the system writes, updates, and runs code live — all directly inside the browser.  
*(It runs locally just to check and update your code.)*  

For me, every bug or failed attempt is just another way to understand systems more deeply. I focus on how things work under the hood and how we can make them work even better.

## 🎯 Learning Never Stops  

I believe logic building comes before development — understanding *why* things work makes *how* much easier.  
Still learning. Still experimenting. Still building.
